# Icon Preview

Preview icons at different sizes for web, iOS and Android.


## Previewing an icon

1. Select an icon and run the plugin (must be a frame or group).
2. You will see a list of icons at different sizes for different platforms. Scroll to view more.

## Refreshing changes

1. Once you've edited your icon just select "Refresh" to preview your changes.

## Selecting a new icon

There are two ways to do this:
1. Either select a new frame or group and run the plugin again.
2. Or select the current icon in the bottom right of the plugin window and then inspect another icon.

## Things to note

The plugin currently only supports frames and groups under 257px in width and height for performance reasons. This may change in future versions. I want to hear your suggestions and feedback, pleaset get in touch using the support link on the right.
